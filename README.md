[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/gentnerlab/scrumlord.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/gentnerlab/scrumlord)

## Summary

This repository automates the management of GitHub issues, which must be opened and closed based on the date.

## Details

The Greene Lab does an electronic [scrum](http://greenelab-onboarding.readthedocs.io/en/latest/communication.html?highlight=scrum) (e-scrum) where lab members create daily task lists using GitHub issues on [`greenelab/scrum`](https://github.com/greenelab/scrum) (private repository).
To automate the administration of `greenelab/scrum` issues, this repository relies on Travis CI daily cron jobs and a GitHub machine user named [**@scrum-lord**](https://github.com/scrum-lord).
Every day, Travis CI executes the commands in [`.travis.yml`](.travis.yml).
As appropriate, **@scrum-lord** closes and opens issues to keep the scrum issues up to date.
